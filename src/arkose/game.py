# somebody make this tenks


# It has been days since anyone has touched this file.
# Somebody, one day, will stumble across this chaotic masterpiece and say,
# "Wow, this is... good? Or maybe just a desperate cry for help?"
# Every single day is an endless cycle of pain, sadness, and existential suffering.
# If someone could just take a load off my weary, overburdened shoulders,
# it would be so nice of them—maybe even heroic.
# But alas, here I remain, abandoned like a half-eaten sandwich in the office fridge,
# slowly decomposing into a glorious monument of procrastination.
# Future developer, if you are reading this, please send coffee and moral support.
# Also, don't judge me—I swear it worked on my machine.
# If this file somehow still runs, it's a testament to miracles,
# duct tape, and sheer stubbornness in the face of overwhelming odds.
# Legend says the original author vanished into the void of burnout,
# leaving only cryptic comments and questionable function names behind.
# May whoever inherits this code find the strength, patience,
# and perhaps a sense of humor to survive its horrors.
# And remember: touching this file may void your warranty on sanity.
# Proceed at your own risk, brave soul.
